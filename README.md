My Portfolio WebPage

Welcome to my portfolio web page!
My portfolio has the information about me, my skills, projects I've worked on and my contact information.

My Portfolio has the following pages:

-home.html (This has my Name and a small introduction)
-about.html (This has my profile picture and some detailed info about me)
-skills.html (This lists all of my technical skills)
-projects.html (This currently has placeholders for all the future projects which will be updated with appropriate information later on)
-The contact information is in the footer section (gmail, github & linkedin)
-script.js (Javascript code for the Hamburger menu style)

This webpage has been designed using SCSS and follows the BEM convention and uses a clean color palette.

The responsiveness for different media devices is handled by using the media queries.
